# MUI-Tweaks

Tweaks for use with MUI. This is raw usage of metasysAPI and JSON in a chrome extension to hide certain features of MUI, and then resize it.

There is also a Token Refresh program, that sends a token to MUI on a set interval, allowing the display to stay on and not time out.

Unrefined but functional for for intended use.
